# Portal-Inc

This is a React-based application that utilizes the Spotify Web API to allow users to search for music, create custom playlists, view their top tracks and artists, and more.

Upon visiting the application, the user is first directed to a splash page where they can log in with their Spotify account. Once logged in, the user is directed to the home page where they can see a variety of features such as a search bar for searching for specific songs or artists, a "Trending" section displaying popular tracks, and the ability to view and create custom playlists.

The application also includes a "Music Portal" page where users can view their top tracks and artists, as well as receive personalized song recommendations based on their listening history. Additionally, the application includes an "About" page with information about the developers and the application itself.

The application also uses a helper component called Auth which is responsible for handling the user's access token and refreshing it before it expires.

The code also utilizes the react-router-dom library for handling routing and the axios library for making HTTP requests to the Spotify API and a local server.
